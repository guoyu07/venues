## Usage:
### For running locally:
1. checkout the code
2. mvn package

The mvn package will also create a war, which can be used to deploy the application in any Container (tomcat)

Note: application.properties contain client_id and client_secret, which can be generated by visiting 
and signing up at https://foursquare.com/developers/apps.
